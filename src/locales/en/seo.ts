        { question: 'When should I use Format 0 vs Format 1?', answer: 'Use Format 0 in card-based payment systems (ATM, POS, EMV) where PAN is available - it binds the PIN to a specific card number, preventing PIN blocks from being replayed on different cards. Use Format 1 for general-purpose PIN transmission where card binding is not required, such as customer service systems, PIN mailers, or scenarios where PAN is not yet known. Format 1 provides PIN confidentiality but not card binding.' },
        { question: 'What is the padding character and why does it matter?', answer: 'The padding character (typically "F" in hexadecimal) fills the remaining positions after the PIN digits to create a fixed 16-character (8-byte) block for Formats 0-3, or 32-character (16-byte) block for Format 4. This fixed length is required for block cipher encryption algorithms (DES, 3DES, AES). Different payment networks may use different padding: "F" is most common, but some systems use "0" or random hex digits. The padding character must match between encoding and decoding for correct PIN recovery.' },
        { question: 'Can I decode a PIN block without the PAN?', answer: 'Only Format 1 can be decoded without a PAN, because it uses random padding and does not XOR with PAN data. Formats 0, 2, 3, and 4 all require the correct PAN to reverse the XOR operation. If you attempt to decode a Format 0 PIN block with an incorrect PAN, you will get an incorrect PIN. This PAN-binding provides security against PIN block interception attacks - an attacker cannot reuse a captured Format 0 PIN block on a different card.' },

Unlike older formats that use 64-bit blocks (16 hex characters) designed for DES/3DES, Format 4 uses 128-bit blocks (32 hex characters) matching AES block size. It provides enhanced security through larger block size, random padding, and support for longer PINs (up to 12 digits). Format 4 is being adopted in modern payment systems as the industry transitions from 3DES to AES encryption, particularly in EMV contactless and mobile payment applications.' },
        { question: 'How does the PIN length indicator work?', answer: 'The second character of all PIN block formats is the PIN length indicator in hexadecimal. For a 4-digit PIN, it\'s "4"; for a 6-digit PIN, it\'s "6"; for a 12-digit PIN, it\'s "C" (12 in hex). This allows the receiving system to extract exactly the right number of PIN digits from the block. The minimum PIN length is typically 4 digits, maximum is 12 digits. The length indicator is crucial for correct PIN extraction during decoding - without it, the system wouldn\'t know where the PIN ends and padding begins.' },
        { question: 'What security considerations should I know?', answer: 'Never transmit or store PIN blocks without encryption - they should always be encrypted with a PIN Encryption Key (PEK) or Zone PIN Key (ZPK). PIN blocks are only intermediate format; the encrypted PIN block is what travels across networks. Format 0 PIN blocks can be vulnerable to precomputation attacks if the same PAN is used repeatedly - use Format 3 or Format 4 for enhanced security.
